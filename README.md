# Tradezone

Project Title:
TradeZone : Secondhand Goods Marketplace - Buy, Sell, and Trade Pre-owned Products.

Description
The Secondhand Goods Marketplace is a web platform that allows users to buy, sell, and trade used products across various categories. The platform aims to reduce waste and promote sustainability by giving second-life to pre-loved goods. Sellers can list items they no longer need, while buyers can find affordable options with clear product grading and quality descriptions. The platform also supports trade-ins and partnerships with local repair shops for post-purchase services.

Objective
The goal of this project is to create an efficient, organized, and user-friendly marketplace for secondhand goods. It provides users a seamless experience for listing, browsing, and purchasing items, while offering additional features like trade-in programs, price alerts, rewards  and repair services.

Scope
User Registration and Authentication: Buyers and sellers register and log into the platform to list or purchase goods.
Product Listings: Allow users to post listings with photos, descriptions, and a grading system for product condition.
Search and Filter: Filter product listings by category, price range, condition, and more.
Buying and Selling: Users can purchase or sell items, with integrated secure payment systems.
Trade-In Program: Users can trade in old goods for store credit or direct product swaps.
Repair Services: Partner with local shops for post-purchase repairs.
Product reviews or ratings beyond basic buyer-seller feedback.
Target Users

Purpose: Sell secondhand products or trade them in for credit.
Usage: List items, provide product details, and communicate with buyers.
Buyers:
Purpose: Purchase affordable, pre-used goods.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
