Project Title:
TradeZone : Secondhand Goods Marketplace - Buy, Sell, and Trade Pre-owned Products.

Description
The Secondhand Goods Marketplace is a web platform that allows users to buy, sell, and trade used products across various categories. The platform aims to reduce waste and promote sustainability by giving second-life to pre-loved goods. Sellers can list items they no longer need, while buyers can find affordable options with clear product grading and quality descriptions. The platform also supports trade-ins and partnerships with local repair shops for post-purchase services.

Objective
The goal of this project is to create an efficient, organized, and user-friendly marketplace for secondhand goods. It provides users a seamless experience for listing, browsing, and purchasing items, while offering additional features like trade-in programs, price alerts, rewards  and repair services.
